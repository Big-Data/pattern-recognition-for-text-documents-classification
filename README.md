This is the result of my thesis for graduating on Electrical Engineering. It's a classification system with
the following specs:

* naive bayes classifier - algorithms are modified versions of [.Manning et. al.](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/)
* document frequency (DF) feature selection - [.Yiming Yang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~course/cs502/2003/031119/yang97comparative.pdf)
* simple web scraping framework (built upon scrapy) which uses Document Frequency feature selection.

Requirements
============

* Python 2.6+
* Scrapy
